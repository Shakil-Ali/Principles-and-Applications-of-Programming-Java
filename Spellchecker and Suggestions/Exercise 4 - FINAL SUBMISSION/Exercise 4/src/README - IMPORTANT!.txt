****** VERY IMPORTANT - READ ME ******* SHAKIL ALI

WELCOME TO MY SPELLCHECKER AND SPELLCHECKER SUGGESTION PROGRAM!
I HAVE ATTACHED A READ ME FILE TO MY SUBMISSION HOWEVER I WILL REITERATE THAT INFORMATION HERE.

RUNNING ON ECLIPSE/IDE:
PLEASE BEFORE RUNNING ANY CODE PUT THE FILE YOU WANT TO SPELLCHECK IN THE SRC FOLDER. IF NOT YOU CAN USE MY TEST FILES (2  CALLED 
CHECK BUT HAVE DIFFERENT EXTENSIONS e.g. check.java, check.txt).
THEN ALSO PUT YOUR DICTIONARY (LAHCENS DICTIONARY) IN THE SRC AND MAKE SURE IT IS NAMED 'dictionary' with the txt extenision (text file)
IF YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED MY SUBMISSION YOU WILL ALREADY HAVE THE DICTIONARY AND TEST FILE IN THE SRC 
YOU CAN THEN RUN BOTH SPELLCHECK AND SPELLCHECKERSUGGESTION AND THE NEW FILES CREATED WILL APPEAR IN THE SRC.

RUNNING ON CMD/TERMINAL:
WHEN RUNNING ON TERMINAL PLEASE cd into folder 'Exercise 4'. THEN IN THE COMMAND LINE DO 'javac Spellchecker.java' or 'javac SpellcheckerSuggestion.java'. 
THEN DO 'java Spellchecker' or 'java SpellcheckerSuggestion'.
